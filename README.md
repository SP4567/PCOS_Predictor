# PCOS_Predictor

This repo contains the implementation of the PCOS_Predictor

This repository contains the implementation of the PCOS_Predictor, which is a project focused on predicting Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using machine learning techniques.

# Main Function Points

The project provides a machine learning model for predicting PCOS based on various health parameters.

It includes the necessary files, such as the trained model (Final_Pcos_model.h5), a scaler (pcos_scaler.pkl), and a Python script (app.py) to run the prediction.

# Technology Stack

The project is implemented using Python, a popular programming language for data analysis and machine learning.
